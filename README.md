## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Context API
- Local Storage
- Custom Hooks 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) - React library of UI components
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For custom styles
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For simple HTTP request

### What I learned

Even though this project was simple in nature, I managed to include several exciting features. One highlight was the use of custom hooks to save data conveniently to the browser's localStorage. Throughout the development journey, I applied my knowledge and implemented best practices to ensure a high-quality project. I must admit, working with Material UI and Styled Components for the first time presented its own set of challenges. However, despite the difficulties, I persevered and gained valuable insights, ultimately growing as a developer.
